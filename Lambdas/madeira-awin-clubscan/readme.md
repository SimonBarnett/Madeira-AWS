# 🦅 madeira-awin-clubscan Lambda

**Purpose**: Central orchestrator and processor for all AWIN-related automation for Club Madeira.

Handles daily global recommendations, club-specific personalised joins, new advertiser onboarding, merchant catalogue sync, and transaction ingestion.

---

## Quick Start / Setup

This Lambda is designed to be triggered via **Amazon EventBridge Scheduler**, another Lambda, or manually with test events.

### Triggering via Amazon EventBridge Scheduler

This Lambda is invoked on a schedule using **Amazon EventBridge Scheduler**.

Current schedules targeting `madeira-awin-clubscan` include:

- `Awin-Onboarding` — triggers full onboarding + daily report (often with `sandbox` for testing)
- `Awin-HighApproval` — triggers global or high-approval merchant recommendations

These schedules pass structured event payloads (e.g. `{ "onboarding": true }`, `{ "route": "..." }`, or club-specific parameters).

**Key dependencies** (provided via Layers):
- Shared helpers (`/opt/nodejs/helpers`)
- Grok/xAI client (`/opt/nodejs/grok`)
- Auth utilities (`/opt/nodejs/auth-utils`)
- Awin config from SSM (`getAwinConfig`)

**Environment Variables** (some now come from SSM via config layer):

| Variable                        | Notes                                      |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `AWIN_ACCESS_TOKEN`            | From SSM via `getAwinConfig()`             |
| `AWIN_PUBLISHER_ID`            | From SSM via `getAwinConfig()` (2889699)   |
| `GLOBAL_COOLDOWN_DAYS`         | 90 (default)                               |
| `GLOBAL_MAX_RECOMMENDATIONS`   | 20 (default)                               |
| `MIN_RELEVANCE_SCORE`          | 0.5 (default)                              |
| `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_TO`        | Can be overridden in event                 |
| `LOG_LEVEL`                    | debug / info                               |

## Core Concepts

- **Orchestrator pattern**: `index.js` inspects the event and routes to the appropriate handler, reusing a single DB connection pool.
- **Layer-first architecture**: Generic logic (DB, logging, Grok calls, mailer, hashing, config) lives in shared Layers. This Lambda only contains AWIN-specific orchestration and business logic.
- **Idempotent & safe**: Uses `MERGE` statements, cooldown tracking, and sandbox mode for safe testing.
- **Sandbox mode**: Pass `"sandbox": true` to generate test data and route emails to `si@ntsa.uk` (useful for end-to-end validation without hitting real AWIN quotas).

### Business Context: Club Onboarding Flow

When a new **community or club** onboards to the Club Madeira platform, the `club` route is triggered. It generates a curated, personalised list of relevant AWIN advertisers that the **partner can apply to on behalf of the club**.

If the partner successfully onboards the AWIN supplier, they earn an **extra percentage** on all future transactions from that supplier. This creates strong commercial alignment between the partner’s success and the growth of the overall network.
