## Summary of Changes (June 2026 Refactor)

- Removed all calls to the deprecated `/login/claims` endpoint.
- All widgets now use **local JWT decoding** (`decodeToken()`) to read permissions from the token stored in `localStorage`.
- Consolidated token handling into `SystemOTPs` table.
- All routes updated to new structure under `/login/*` and `/ui/*`.
- `partner-widget.js` was cleaned to **pure invite mode** (removed myurls/buyurl/Sites toggle).

## Notes for Partners

- All widgets are **self-contained** and do not require a build step.
- Authentication state is managed via `localStorage` (`authToken`, `user_id`, `contact_name`).
- Most widgets gracefully handle missing tokens by redirecting to the login page.
- For best results, always load `header-widget.js` first.
